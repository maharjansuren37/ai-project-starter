# build - turn the spec into code, one reviewed step at a time

Where this sits:

    `spec` -> build -> `verify` -> `review` -> `ship`

The spec is written and reviewed. This turns it into code without vibe coding:
one small step at a time, each with a visible diff, a plain-English explanation,
and a check that it works - all behind the user's approval.

## Before you start

Read blueprint/context/current-work.md. If it holds no real spec - still the stub, or already
marked complete - stop and say to run `spec` first. Building without a
spec is the thing this workflow exists to prevent.

**The standards are two files:** `blueprint/context/fundamentals.md` holds what
is true regardless of stack and is the pack's - refreshed on every install.
`blueprint/context/coding-standards.md` is this project's and is never
overwritten. **Read both; where they disagree, the project's own file wins.**

**If `coding-standards.md` is still unfilled prompts, say so.** The fundamentals
always apply, but Step 6 tells you to prefer the project's own conventions over
generic best practice, and it cannot do that while the language, layout, imports
and test shape are still comment prompts. `scaffold` fills it for a new project,
`setup` for one that already had code.

## Step 1 - read the state

Read the project's state before acting:

- `blueprint/context/project-overview.md` - the source of truth for what this project is
- `blueprint/context/coding-standards.md` - the conventions this project's code follows
- `blueprint/context/current-work.md` - the one item in flight, if any
- `blueprint/context/findings.md` - open review findings against the current work

Then pull the conventions from `blueprint/context/coding-standards.md` and the data model from
`blueprint/context/project-overview.md` so the code matches what is already there rather than
introducing a second way of doing the same thing.

**Resuming.** If some build steps are already ticked (`- [x]`), this work was
started earlier and interrupted - often by a cleared context. The spec and its
ticked boxes are files, so nothing was lost. Read which steps are done, check the
branch and `git status` to see what is committed versus still in the working tree,
then continue from the **first unchecked step**. Do not start over, and do not
re-do a step that is already ticked.

## Step 2 - get on a branch

Create and check out a branch named from the spec: `feature/<name>` for a feature,
`fix/<name>` for a fix. If the project is not a git repository yet, stop and ask
the user to run `git init` - the loop depends on branches and on being able to
show diffs.

On a resume the branch already exists. Check it out; do not create a second one.

Never build on `main` or `master`.

## Step 3 - build one step, review, iterate

Work the spec's build steps in order, one at a time. For each step:

1. **Implement just that step** - the smallest change that satisfies its
   *done when*. Nothing from a later step, however tempting.

2. **Show the diff**, not whole files.

3. **Confirm the step actually did something, before claiming it passed.**
   **An empty diff means the step did nothing**, whatever the verification
   command says. Check it explicitly:

   - the diff is **non-empty**
   - every file the step said it would create **exists and is not empty**
   - the change landed where it was meant to, not in a path created by a typo

   This is not paranoia. A step once wrote two files into a directory that did
   not exist, both writes failed, and **the verification command still returned
   exit 0** - the test runner was set to pass with no tests, and the untouched
   template still built. Nothing about that green check was false; it simply had
   nothing to do with the step. Unattended, it would have carried the run forward
   on nothing.

   **A passing verification does not mean the step happened.** It means the
   project is in a good state, which is equally true of a step that changed
   nothing at all.

4. **Explain it in plain English.** What the step delivered, one line per changed
   file on what it does and why. This is the comprehension gate: the user should
   finish reading it able to explain the change to someone else. Keep it concrete,
   not ceremonial.

5. **Prove the done-when.** Name the evidence: build output, a passing assertion,
   a screenshot. If the project declares a verification command, run that exact
   command - it is an umbrella over checks the project actually has, so never
   invent a test runner or a check just to have something to run. A step that adds
   real logic ships its test in the same diff when a test runner is configured.
   UI and integration steps ride on a screenshot plus a green build. When a
   done-when is behavioral - a click, a download, a flow across screens - run
   `verify` against the running app rather than eyeballing it.

   **Check the done-when on its own terms, not just that the suite is green.** If
   it says "tests cover the mapping", the test count must have gone up and those
   tests must exist - a runner configured to pass with no tests reports success
   for a step that added none. If it says a string appears in the output, look for
   the string. **Match the evidence to the claim the step actually made.**

   **A new test is not trusted until it has failed once.** Break the thing it
   covers, watch it go red, put it back. **And check the break was real** - a
   mutation that changes no behaviour leaves the test passing against code that
   was meant to be broken, and that looks identical to a proven test. Reversing a
   list whose elements carry their own order is the shape to watch for: the rows
   come back the same and nothing is learned. **If a test still passes after you
   broke it, suspect the mutation before the test.**

6. **Iterate until it works - but stop guessing after the second try.** If it
   fails, or the user wants it different, revise the step, show the updated diff,
   and re-check. Nothing is committed until the user is happy with the step.

   **If the same step fails twice and you cannot say why, stop and run `debug`.**
   A third attempt made without understanding the cause is a guess, and a guess
   that happens to go green is worse than the failure - it retires the question
   while leaving the cause in place. `debug` reproduces and isolates without
   touching product code, then hands the evidence back here. Say plainly that you
   do not know the cause; "I am changing this because I think it might be it" is
   the sentence that should trigger it.

7. **Tick it off, then offer the checkpoint.** Once approved, check the step off
   (`- [x]`) in `blueprint/context/current-work.md` so progress survives a context clear. If the
   step repaired a finding in `blueprint/context/findings.md`, set that finding to `fixed` and
   note the repair in its **Resolution** line - never to `closed`, because a repair
   is re-reviewed by `review` before it clears. A fix can introduce a worse
   defect than the one it removed.

   Then offer a short choice:

   - **Continue** *(default)* - straight into the next step, no commit.
   - **Commit checkpoint** - commit just this step on the branch with a
     conventional message. A cheap rollback point, entirely optional.
   - **Walk me through it** - a deeper, line-level explanation of the new code:
     why this approach, what each part does, what to watch out for. Then re-ask
     this choice. It is a loop-back, not a terminal answer.
   - **Run the rest unattended** - hand the remaining steps to
     `autopilot build..review`, which resumes from the first unchecked step and
     ends with a review packet rather than stopping after each one.
   - **Stop here** - pause. Say where things stand: the branch is intact, the
     ticked steps record the progress, `build` resumes from the first
     unchecked step.

**Offer the unattended option by name, not just when asked.** Per-step review
earns its keep on the first step of an item, where the code reveals decisions the
spec could not have - a column type, a default, a tool that reports success
having done nothing. **By the third step it is usually ceremony**, and a workflow
that treats every step as equally deserving of scrutiny teaches people to stop
reading. The option existing in another skill's documentation is not the same as
offering it at the moment it is wanted.

## When a step makes configuration *required*

Removing a default is the usual shape - a fallback secret deleted, an optional
setting made mandatory, a validated environment variable. The change is correct
and it **breaks every environment that was quietly relying on the default**.

**The local run is the one place it will not show**, because the person making
the change has the value exported in their shell. Everything passes, and the
next environment to start is the one that fails - CI on the next push, or
production on the next deploy, which is worse.

So when a step makes a value required:

- **Add it to the Environments table in `AGENTS.md`** for every environment
  listed, not only the one in front of you. That table exists to be the list.
- **Name it in the Deployment section** of the plan if it is not already there -
  `host` and `deploy` read that section, not this file.
- **Check the pipeline supplies it.** A pipeline is an environment; it is simply
  one nobody thinks of as one until it goes red.
- **Say it in the handoff.** "This now requires `X` to be set" is a sentence the
  next person needs, and it is invisible in a diff that only shows a default
  being deleted.
- **If a person has to supply the value, it goes in
  `blueprint/context/needs-you.md`** - generating a key, getting an API token,
  choosing a database URL. **Naming a variable is not the same as assigning the
  work of producing one.** A name in `.env.example` says the variable exists; the
  needs-you line says someone must act, what happens until they do, and by when.
  Without it the requirement is recorded in three files and owned by nobody, and
  the first person to find out is whoever starts the app next.

The same applies in reverse to anything that starts reading a new variable, even
with a default: a default that is wrong in production is a silent failure rather
than a loud one.

## Step 4 - clear the findings gate, then hand off

Before handing off, read blueprint/context/findings.md. A P0 or P1 finding still `open` or
`fixed` will block `ship`, so close the loop now:

- **Repair each open P0 or P1 as an extra reviewed step.** First append it to the
  spec's build steps (`- [ ] Repair F-03 - <title>`) so the repair is on the record
  and survives a context clear, then run it through Step 3 like any other step.
  Tick the step and mark the finding `fixed` together.
- **Then run `review`** so those repairs are re-reviewed and can move to
  `closed`. A repair never closes itself.
- **Never set `accepted` or `invalid`.** `accepted` is the user's explicit
  decision with a recorded reason; `invalid` is a `review` verdict backed
  by evidence. Neither is this skill's call.

When every step is built and the project's checks pass, stop with a compact
review packet:

- the branch name
- what changed, grouped by file or area
- checks run, with the exact command or proof used
- how to try it by hand, or a pointer to `verify`
- ledger state: any findings still `open` or `fixed`, by ID
- known risks, skipped checks, or follow-ups
- next action, usually `review` then `ship`

**In a multi-part project, post the packet** in `<product root>/blueprint/status/<this part>.md`:

    **State:** waiting
    **Item:** <the item just built>
    **Blocked on:** -
    **Review packet:** <where to read it>
    **Updated:** <today>

That path comes from `AGENTS.md`'s `Product root:` -
this part's own `blueprint/` is a different directory, and writing there means
the coordinator never sees it. The packet is not a message to nobody: the
review queue is what `autopilot` counts before starting another unattended run,
and a packet that stays in a transcript is invisible to that count. **A cap on
work nobody has posted counts to zero forever.**

**If a step cannot proceed because it needs another part**, write the block
rather than only reporting it:

    **State:** blocked
    **Blocked on:** <part> - <what is needed>

Same reason as the packet, and the same failure: `orchestrate` detects deadlock
and stale blocks by reading this field, so a block that lives only in the
conversation is one it will never find. It reports the part as building, forever.

## Rules

**Small steps, each one reviewed.** Every step ends with the app working and a
diff small enough to read in full. If a diff is too big to read in one sitting,
the step was too big - split it. That review gate is the entire point of this
workflow; batching the work into one large diff defeats it.

**Evidence, or it didn't happen.** Never report "passes", "works", or "verified"
without naming what proves it - the command and its output, the screenshot, the
response body. "I couldn't verify this" and "this failed" are useful, honest
results. A fabricated pass is worse than no check at all, because it retires the
question.

**Build only what the spec says.** If the spec is wrong, thin, or missing a case,
stop and fix the spec first - do not improvise past it. Work that nobody spec'd
is work nobody reviewed.

- **A green check is not evidence a step happened.** Confirm the diff is
  non-empty and the claimed files exist before trusting any verification result.
- **Explain every change in plain English.** Understanding the code is the point
  of the whole loop. A step the user cannot explain back has not really landed.
- **Never commit code the user has not approved.** Per-step commits are optional
  checkpoints; the work-level commit, the merge, and any push belong to
  `ship`. This skill never touches `main`.
- **Follow `blueprint/context/coding-standards.md`** over generic best practice. The project's existing
  patterns win.

## Formatting

Match the conventions in `blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md` when it exists: short, scannable
markdown, lists for enumerations, a table when comparing options. Otherwise keep
it brief and direct by the same standard. Long prose blocks are the failure mode
to avoid - this output gets read while someone is mid-task.
