# monitor - know when it breaks, before someone tells you

Where this sits:

Two jobs: **set the signals up**, and **read them when something is wrong**.

## Before you start

**If nothing is deployed yet, say so and stop.** There is nothing to watch, and
signals wired against an environment that does not exist look configured while
reporting nothing - which is worse than no monitoring, because it retires the
question.

`architect` records the failure modes worth watching. **If that is missing, say
which signals you are choosing and why**, rather than collecting everything and
reading none of it.

## Input

- *(no argument)* - set up, or report on what is already set up.
- **a description of a problem** - investigate it. Skip to the investigating
  section.

## Step 1 - work out what actually needs watching

**Read what `stack` already chose**, in the plan's Tech section - the tool and,
more importantly, **where an alert goes.** This skill wires a decision; it does
not make one. If the plan says "nothing, I will look at it when I notice", that
is a decision and this skill's job is to say what that leaves uncovered, not to
overturn it.

**If the plan is silent, say so and settle it here rather than picking quietly** -
a monitoring service is an account and a recurring cost, and choosing one on the
user's behalf months after `stack` ran is how a project acquires a dependency
nobody agreed to.

**Start from `architect`'s system design, not from a vendor's feature list.** If
it named failure modes and the signals that would reveal them, those signals are
the requirement. This is where that decision gets cashed in - or found to have
been skipped.

If there is no such list, derive a short one now:

- what breaks first, and what it looks like from outside
- what a user would notice, in what order
- which external dependency failing would be worst

Then the four that almost every project needs:

- **Is it up?** An uptime check against a real endpoint.
- **Is it erroring?** Unhandled exceptions, with a stack trace and enough context
  to find the cause.
- **Is it slow?** Response times, at least at the slower end - an average hides
  everything that matters.
- **Is anyone using it?** Enough to tell "no errors because it is healthy" from
  "no errors because nobody came."

**Collect what will be read.** A dashboard nobody opens is worse than nothing,
because it feels like coverage.

## Step 2 - propose the setup, with its cost

Say what you would use, per signal, and what it costs - including the free tier's
real limits and what happens when they are crossed. Prefer what the host already
provides over a new service; one fewer account is worth a slightly worse tool.

**Stop for approval before creating any account or installing anything.**

## Step 3 - wire it up

- Add the client, and confirm errors actually arrive - **trigger a test error and
  see it land.** An error tracker nobody has tested is a guess.
- **Scrub sensitive data** before it is sent: no tokens, no passwords, no
  personal data in error context. This is a real leak path.
- Set the environment name, **taken from the Environments table in `AGENTS.md`
  so it matches what `deploy` reports**, and staging noise is not mistaken for
  production. Two skills spelling the same environment differently is how an
  alert gets ignored.
- Point the uptime check at an endpoint that **exercises the database**, not a
  static page that responds while everything behind it is down.
- **On a server you own, watch the box as well as the app**: disk (releases and
  logs fill it quietly, and the first symptom is a deploy that cannot write),
  memory, and **certificate expiry as a dated alert rather than a hope**. A
  managed platform hides these; here nothing else is looking.
- Keep logs structured enough to search, and **never log a secret**.

## Step 4 - decide what is worth waking up for

**Alert on what a person would act on, and nothing else.** An alert that fires
often and means nothing trains people to ignore the one that matters.

For most projects that is a very short list: the site is down, errors have spiked
well above normal, the database is nearly out of space or connections.

**Detection without delivery is not monitoring.** A check that notices a problem
and writes it to a log nobody reads has moved the failure, not caught it - and it
is worse than no check, because the setup exists and looks like coverage. **Name
the channel and prove one message arrives through it**, the same way a backup is
not a backup until a restore has been tried.

This is where a self-managed box differs sharply from a managed platform: the
platform has somewhere to send things and a box has nothing until you give it
one. A local check with no mail transport, no webhook and no push service **can
detect everything and tell no one.**

Say where alerts go, and **be honest that a solo project usually has no
escalation** - it goes to one person, who may be asleep. That is a real
constraint worth writing down rather than pretending otherwise.

**And say what the monitoring cannot see.** A check that runs on the box being
watched cannot report that the box is off - which is the most total failure
available. Either accept it explicitly or put one check somewhere else.

## Step 5 - report

- what is watched, and what is not
- what would fire an alert, and where it goes
- the cost
- **the gaps** - the failure modes from Step 1 with no signal covering them.
  Naming them is more useful than a dashboard.

Record it in `dev-notes/status.md`.

## Investigating a live problem

1. **What is the actual symptom?** What a user sees, when it started, whether it
   is still happening.
2. **Was it a deploy?** Compare the start time against the last release. If they
   match, **roll back first** with `deploy rollback` and investigate afterwards.
3. **Gather evidence** - error rate and the traces behind it, response times, the
   dependency health, recent changes.
4. **Say what you know and what you are guessing.** In a live incident the
   distinction matters more than usual.
5. **Hand off:** `debug` to isolate it properly, then `spec` and `build` to fix
   it through the normal loop. **Never patch production directly** - an
   unreviewed fix under time pressure is how the second outage starts.

## Reading the signals when nothing is broken

**This is the half of monitoring that gets skipped**, and it is the only place
this workflow learns anything from the outside. Every other loop here is closed
between the plan and the code: `spec` reads the plan, `build` reads the spec,
`review` reads the code, `ship` updates the plan. **Reality only ever gets in
through this step.** Without it the project can be perfectly executed against a
plan nobody has checked against use.

Run it deliberately - after a release has settled, or on whatever rhythm suits -
and ask four questions of the signals already collected:

- **What is anyone actually using?** A feature with no traffic is either
  undiscoverable, unwanted, or unfinished, and those need different responses.
  It is also the cheapest thing to *remove*, which `rollback` exists for.
- **Where does it hurt?** The slowest real path, the most common error, the thing
  people retry. Compare against `blueprint/context/quality-bar.md`: a path missing
  the project's own recorded number is a plan item, not a vague concern.
- **What are people asking for or working around?** Support messages, repeated
  manual steps, a spreadsheet someone keeps alongside the app.
- **What is costing money, and is it worth it?** Usage against the bill.

**Then turn it into plan items, or say plainly that there is nothing to change.**
Propose each as one item-sized line for `blueprint/build-plan.md` and hand off to
`spec`, which owns the plan-addition gate - it will check whether the item changes
direction, data or stack, and stop for approval before writing. **Do not edit the
build plan from here.**

**Distinguish the three, because they route differently:** something *broken* goes
to `debug`; something *slower than the bar* is an item for `spec`; something the
users want that was never planned is a change to the plan itself, and if it moves
the project's shape it belongs back at `architect` rather than in a spec.

**"The signals say nothing worth acting on" is a real and common result.** Record
it and move on. Inventing work from a quiet dashboard is worse than reading
nothing, because it spends the project's remaining attention on noise.

## Rules

- **Watch what was designed to be watched.** Signals come from the failure modes,
  not from what a tool makes easy.
- **Test that a signal works** before trusting it.
- **Never send or log a secret or personal data.**
- **Alert only on what someone would act on.**
- **Never fix production directly.** Roll back, then go through the loop.
- **Report gaps honestly.** Unmonitored is a fact worth knowing.

## Formatting

Match `blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md` when it exists: short, scannable
markdown, lists for enumerations, a table when comparing options.
