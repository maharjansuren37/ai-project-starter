# context - generate the source of truth from the plans

Where this sits:

    `blueprint/project-plan.md` + `blueprint/build-plan.md` -> context -> `blueprint/context/project-overview.md`

You own the two planning docs. This distills them into one file the agent loads
every session. The direction is one-way on purpose: **edit the plans and
regenerate, never hand-edit the overview.** A hand-edit is lost on the next run
and, worse, silently disagrees with the plans until then.

## Before you start

**If `blueprint/project-plan.md` or `blueprint/build-plan.md` does not exist, stop
and say to run `ideate` first.** This skill distils the plans; it does not write
them.

**Two sections of `blueprint/project-plan.md` must hold real content, not the
seeded instruction text, because Step 3 generates directly from them:**

- **6. Architecture** - filled by `architect`, which now runs first
- **5. Tech** - filled by `stack`, against that architecture

The loop is `ideate -> architect -> stack -> layout -> scaffold -> ci -> context`, so by the
time this runs legitimately both have happened. Checking it here costs nothing and
**a gap is not a contradiction** - Step 2 stops only on plans that disagree with
themselves, so without this a plan that is merely *unfinished* passes straight
through it.

**How to tell a section is unfilled: the seeded instruction sentence is still
present**, whatever has been added around it. **Do not use length or
non-emptiness.** A plan can carry a real, useful block *underneath* the seeded
text - genuine constraints on a stack nobody has chosen yet - and that section is
still unfilled, because the decision Step 3 generates from has not been made. That
shape is the careful case, not the exotic one: it is what someone writes while
waiting for `stack`. A length test reads it as filled and generates a Stack
section describing no stack.

**Check both sections before stopping, and report every unfilled one in a single
stop, in loop order** - `architect` before `stack`. In the normal case they are
unfilled together, because neither skill has run: stopping at the first sends the
user away, and stops them again on the second when they return.

**Read both plans anyway and give Step 2's findings alongside the stop, as
advisory.** The stop already costs a round trip; it should buy everything this
skill can see rather than one sentence. A build plan that is not a checklist is
readable now, and discovering it on the next run is a second trip for something
that was on screen the first time.

Step 2 checks the plans for shape problems and is the second gate - a half-template
plan generates an authoritative-looking overview full of nothing, and every skill
downstream reads that file as the source of truth.

## Step 1 - read both plans

Read `blueprint/project-plan.md` and `blueprint/build-plan.md` in full. Also read
`blueprint/context/project-overview.md` if it already exists, so you can report what your regeneration
changes.

## Step 2 - validate the shape, before generating anything

Generating a confident overview from a plan that is still half template produces
an authoritative-looking file full of nothing. Check for:

- **Placeholder text.** Sections still holding the seeded instructions rather
  than the user's own content.
- **A build plan that is not a checklist.** If items are plain bullets with no
  `- [ ]`, the loop cannot track progress. Propose the checkbox version.
- **Items that are not item-sized.** "Auth, billing, and dashboard" on one line
  is three items. "Make it nice" is not an item at all.
- **Contradictions.** A feature the stack cannot support, data in the model that
  no feature reads or writes, an architecture describing a platform the Tech
  section does not name.
- **A data model the stack already owns.** The model is written before the stack
  now, so a library chosen later may create and migrate tables the plan also
  specifies by hand - an auth library owning users and sessions is the common
  case, and a plan written earlier almost always describes a `User` table with
  columns. **Two of them drift, and the bug arrives at the second migration.**
  `stack` is meant to reconcile this when it chooses; check it did, because
  nothing else looks.
- **Missing decisions the build will immediately need.** No stack at all, or no
  data model while half the features store things.

Report what you found. For anything mechanical - checkbox conversion, splitting
an oversized item - propose the exact replacement text and get approval before
writing it.

**A contradiction the user has to resolve stops this skill.** Do not generate an
overview from plans that disagree with themselves, and do not pick a side on
their behalf. Say what conflicts and ask.

**So does a gap in a section Step 3 generates from.** A contradiction and an
unfilled section both produce an overview that is wrong, and only one of them
looks wrong while you are writing it - which is why the Tech and Architecture
checks are preconditions above rather than entries in the list here. Reporting
"no stack yet" and then generating a Stack section anyway is the failure this
step exists to prevent, performed by the step itself.

## Step 3 - generate the overview

Write `blueprint/context/project-overview.md`, covering:

- **What this is** - the problem, in the user's own framing, and who it is for.
- **Scope** - what the first version includes, and what is explicitly deferred.
- **Stack** - the chosen technologies and the reasoning that survived from the
  plan. An agent reading this should not re-litigate a settled decision.
- **Architecture** - structure, data model, where logic lives, the auth boundary.
- **Constraints** - anything that rules an approach out: hosting, budget, a
  platform requirement, an existing system it must fit.
- **Current state** - which items are checked off, what is in flight, what is
  next.

Write it for an agent joining with no other context. Prefer concrete detail over
summary: this file replaces reading everything else, so vagueness here becomes
vagueness in every session that loads it.

Mark it as generated at the top, with the instruction to edit the plans instead.

**Then fill `AGENTS.md`'s `## What this is`** with the same problem statement,
cut to two or three sentences. It ships as a placeholder comment and **no other
skill writes it** - so without this the entry point every tool reads opens with
an empty section in a project whose plans have been complete for weeks.

It is not a duplicate of the overview. `CLAUDE.md` loads
`project-overview.md`, but every other tool reads `AGENTS.md` and may never open
the overview at all: this section is the only project description some agents
will ever see. Keep it short and replace it whenever the problem statement in
the plan changes - **but leave it alone if someone has already written prose
there**, since it is a user-owned file and a hand-written description beats a
regenerated one.

## Step 4 - report what changed

If an overview already existed, say what this regeneration changed - new items,
a changed stack, a resolved contradiction. If this is the first generation, say
so. **Say whether `AGENTS.md`'s `## What this is` was filled, left alone because
it already had prose, or updated** - it is a user-owned file, so a write to it
is never silent.

Then point at what is next:

- `architect` if the architecture section is still thin
- **`prototype` if the first item is a screen and no visual reference exists** -
  building a design from prose alone is how an approximation lands and then
  becomes what the app permanently looks like
- otherwise `spec` to start the first item

## When to re-run

- After editing either planning doc.
- After `spec` adds a new item to the build plan.
- **After every `ship`.** It ticks an item off the build plan and resets the
  spec, so *Current state* - the item count, what is next, what is in flight -
  is wrong the moment it finishes. This is the most frequent reason to re-run
  and was the one missing from this list.
- After anything that changes direction, users, data, stack, or deployment.

It is cheap and idempotent. Re-running it when nothing changed produces the same
file.

**Check the build plan describes *this* product before generating anything.**
Placeholder items shipped in the template for a long time, and a project that
never deleted them carries items for a product that does not exist. Every skill
reading that file treats an unchecked box as real work - `spec` specs the first
one, `progress` counts it as remaining, `prepare` files a requirement for a
service it names. **The tell is an item that does not match the plan's own
description of the product**, and the answer is to stop and say so rather than
generate an overview around it: an overview built on the wrong items is
confidently wrong in the one file every other skill trusts.

## Rules

- **Never invent content the plans do not support.** A gap in the plan is
  reported as a gap, not filled in with something plausible.
- **Never hand-resolve a contradiction.** Stop and ask.
- **The overview is generated, the plans are owned.** Never edit
  `blueprint/project-plan.md` or `blueprint/build-plan.md` without showing the exact change
  and getting approval first.

## Formatting

Match the conventions in `blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md` when it exists: short, scannable
markdown, lists for enumerations, a table when comparing options. Otherwise keep
it brief and direct by the same standard. Long prose blocks are the failure mode
to avoid - this output gets read while someone is mid-task.
