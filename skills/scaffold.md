# scaffold - stand the whole stack up, then check your own work

Where this sits:

    stack -> architect -> scaffold -> `ci` -> context -> spec

`stack` decided what to build with. This builds it. **It is bigger than running
the framework's CLI** - a stack of "Next.js, Postgres, Prisma, Auth.js, Tailwind,
Vitest" is six installs, a schema init, an environment file, and a test script.


> **In a multi-part project**, two files live at the **product root**, not in

> `blueprint/context/quality-bar.md` (the bar the whole product is held to -
> `architect` runs at the root and writes one there, not one per part).

## Before you start

Read the Tech section of `blueprint/project-plan.md`. If it is empty or still
placeholder text, **stop** and say to run `stack` first. This skill installs a
decision; it does not make one.

**Read the Architecture section for the code layout**, which `architect` decides:
one application, or two parts in their own directories. That determines whether
this skill scaffolds once or twice and into which directories, so it is not
optional detail - it is the shape of everything below. It may also name an
integration that needs a client library.

**If the Architecture section is missing, treat the layout as one application**
and say so. That is the right default and most projects take it.

**But stop if the plan clearly implies more than one part and nothing has decided
the layout** - a Tech section naming a separate backend language, say. Scaffolding
into a guessed layout means installing a framework, a lockfile and a dependency
directory into a directory that is about to move. Say to run `architect` first;
it is a few minutes there against a full reinstall here.

## Step 1 - work out everything the stack implies

Expand the recorded decision into the complete list. For each piece, know the
command and the version it will install. Cover:

- the **framework** and its scaffolder
- the **language** and runtime version
- **database** client, ORM or query builder, and its init step
- **auth** library
- **styling**
- **test runner**, plus whatever it needs to run the project's kind of tests
- **linter and formatter**
- anything an **integration** in the plan requires

**Pin versions rather than taking a floating latest**, so this project is the
same if scaffolded again next month.

**Then check the runtime can actually run them, before installing anything.**
Compare the installed runtime version against what each package requires. This is
not theoretical: on a real run, Node 20.18.1 with a floating `latest` pulled a
framework requiring `^20.19.0` - short by a single patch version. **npm reported
that as a warning, exited 0, and installed anyway**; the failure surfaced much
later as an unreadable "cannot find native binding" error at build time, which
looks like a broken install rather than a version mismatch.

**A missing `engines` field means unknown, not compatible.** Expo declares none
at all, so there is nothing to compare against - and on that same machine its own
`expo-doctor` reported the runtime as unsupported anyway. When the metadata is
silent, **run the framework's own health check** (`expo-doctor`, `flutter
doctor`), which knows things a manifest does not.

So: if the runtime is below what a package requires, **stop and say so before
installing**. The options are to upgrade the runtime or to pin the package to a
version the current runtime supports - and the second is usually right, because
the plan already named a version. In that same run, pinning to the version the
plan actually specified built cleanly in about a second.

**Unless the plan is what named the impossible version** - and then neither
option is available here. `stack` checks the runtime before recording a version,
but a plan written before that check, or one whose machine has changed since,
can name a current stable the runtime cannot run. Pinning "to what the plan
said" then makes it worse, and pinning to something else is re-deciding the
stack in the middle of installing it.

**Route back to `stack`.** Say which package, which version the plan named, what
the runtime is, and what it requires. That is a technology decision surfacing
one step late, and it is the same call `architect` makes when the quality bar
needs something the stack cannot give - cheap to redo in the plan, expensive to
unpick from an installed dependency tree. **Do not choose a replacement version
yourself**: the plan records versions with reasons, and a version changed here
arrives with none.

## Step 2 - check the toolchain is actually installed *and usable*

**Installed, running, and usable are three different things**, and a database is
where they come apart. A server can be installed, listening on its port, and
still refuse you because there is no role for your user - which reads as a
connection error at the moment you first try to write a schema, several steps
after you would have wanted to know.

**Prove the connection, do not infer it from the process.** Create the
development database and connect to it as the user the app will use, before
anything is installed. `pg_isready` answering is not the same as `createdb`
succeeding.

**And this is one of the things `scaffold` does not do for you.** Creating a role
or a database cluster is system configuration, usually needs a superuser, and is
the user's decision the same way installing an SDK is. Report the exact command
that would fix it and stop; do not run it and do not work around it by quietly
choosing a different database.

**An SDK is not one thing, and the piece you need may be packaged separately.**
Checking the toolchain answers only that *a* toolchain is there. Check the
specific runtime, target or component the chosen framework needs:

- **.NET** splits into separate packages on most Linux distributions, and
  **running and building need different ones.** `dotnet --version` reports the
  SDK happily and `dotnet new console` builds, while `dotnet new webapi`
  produces a project that cannot build: `NETSDK1226: Prune Package data not
  found ... Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`. Installing the ASP.NET *runtime* does not
  fix it - that is what runs an app. Building against it needs the **targeting
  pack** as well, and the error is identical before and after, so it reads as
  though the install did nothing. On Arch that is three packages: `dotnet-sdk`,
  `aspnet-runtime`, `aspnet-targeting-pack`. Check `/usr/share/dotnet/packs/`
  for a `.Ref` entry, not just `dotnet --list-runtimes`.
- **Python** can have a working interpreter and no `pip`. Several distributions
  strip it from the system install deliberately: `python3 -m pip` fails while
  `python3 -m venv` works and pip exists inside the venv. Check the way the
  project will actually install things.
- **Mobile** needs a platform SDK and often a licence accepted, neither of which
  the language toolchain implies.

**The generic form: build and run something in the shape the project will
actually take**, not the version command - and note those are two checks, not
one. A toolchain that can run an application cannot necessarily compile one, and
the piece that compiles is routinely packaged separately. A version number proves an executable exists and nothing about
whether the specific thing you need is present - and the failure surfaces later,
as a build error that reads like a broken project rather than a missing package.

**A project with no framework still has a toolchain** - the language runtime and
its package manager - and it gets the same check. What it does not have is a
scaffolder, so there is nothing to fetch on demand and nothing to verify beyond
the runtime.

**Not every scaffolder can be fetched on demand.** `npx` pulls `create-vite` and
`create-expo-app` when needed, so Node is the only prerequisite. Flutter is
different: `flutter create` needs the full SDK installed system-wide first, and
so do the native mobile paths, which need Xcode or Android Studio.

Before proposing anything, check what the chosen stack requires is present:

- **Node ecosystem** - `node` and a package manager. `npx` handles the rest.
- **Flutter** - `flutter --version`. Without it, nothing here can run.
- **Native iOS / Android** - Xcode or Android Studio, and their command-line
  tools.
- **Python, Go, Rust** - the toolchain and its package manager.

**If it is missing, stop and say so, with what installing it involves** - roughly
how large, how long, and whether it is a system-wide change. Then let the user
install it and come back.

**Never install a language toolchain or SDK yourself.** Adding project
dependencies is what this skill does; installing multi-gigabyte system software
is a different kind of decision, and it belongs to the user.

## Step 3 - show the whole plan, and stop

List every command in order, with one line on what each is for, and what the
resulting project will contain.

**This is the approval gate.** Scaffolding writes a lot of files and pulls a lot
from the network. Choosing a stack was not a yes to installing it. Wait.

## Step 4 - create the project

**First: is there a scaffolder at all?** The rest of this step exists to work
around framework CLIs, and a project with no framework has none to work around.
Do not force one - a `create-*` command that fits badly leaves a web app's
scaffolding around something that is not a web app, and every one of those files
is then yours to explain or delete.

**No scaffolder** - a command-line tool, a library, a plain script, sometimes a
small service. This is a normal case, not a degraded one, and it is *simpler*
than the branch below rather than harder. Build it directly, in this order:

1. **The manifest**, written by hand at the repository root: name, the module
   system, the entry point, and the `engines` field or its equivalent. **Write
   `engines` even when nothing demands it** - it is what Step 2's check reads on
   every later run, and "unspecified" is not "compatible".
2. **The source root** - `src/`, unless the language's own convention says
   otherwise (`lib/` for a Ruby gem, the package path for Go). One directory, no
   scaffolding, no placeholder folders for structure the project has not needed
   yet.
3. **One entry point that actually runs**, however small - a CLI that prints its
   usage and exits 0, a service that answers one route, a library that exports one
   real thing. **Step 8 has to prove this project runs, and without an entry point
   there is nothing to run** - which is how a scaffold ends up "proved" by a
   typecheck alone. This is a first line of the product, not a placeholder: a file
   exporting `true` satisfies the letter of the step and none of its purpose, and
   the first real item deletes it anyway.
4. **The test runner**, installed and *proved on one real assertion*. A runner
   with no test is the setup that reports success forever - the same failure as a
   suite configured to pass with no tests.
5. **The scripts** the project will actually be driven by, including **one
   verification command** that runs the checks together. `ci` stops without one,
   and a project with no build step still needs a typecheck or a lint to have
   anything worth running.

Nothing is merged and nothing is moved, so the collision rules below do not
apply. Go to Step 5. **Say in your report that there was no scaffolder** - it is
a fact about the project, not an omission.

**There is a scaffolder** - continue here.

The directory already holds `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.agents/`,
`blueprint/`, `dev-notes/`, `README.md`, and `.gitignore`. **Every common
framework CLI refuses to run in a non-empty directory**, so running it here fails.

Instead:

1. Run the scaffolder in a **temporary directory**, where it works normally.
2. **Check it actually produced something. Do not trust the exit code.** Run
   against a non-empty directory, `create-vite` prints "Operation cancelled",
   writes nothing, and **exits 0** - so a script checking only the status would
   report success on an empty result. Confirm the expected files exist before
   going further.
3. Move the result into the project.
4. **Never overwrite a workflow file.** `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, the two adapter
   directories, everything under `blueprint/` and `dev-notes/` are off limits.
5. **Never copy the scaffolder's `.git/` directory.** Several - `create-expo-app`
   among them - initialise their own repository. Copying it over the existing one
   destroys the project's history. Exclude it from the move entirely.
6. Where a file legitimately exists in both:
   - **`.gitignore`** - merge the framework's entries into the existing file.
     Never replace it; it already protects `.env`.
   - **`README.md`** - the project's own README stays. Keep anything genuinely
     useful from the framework's version by folding it into the Running section.
   - **`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`** - a scaffolder may generate these too, and
     what they say can matter. `create-expo-app` writes an `AGENTS.md` saying the
     SDK has changed and to read the versioned docs before writing any code -
     the framework itself warning that your training is stale. **Keep the
     project's file and fold that content into it**, verbatim, under the stack
     and versions section. Never overwrite, and never silently discard.
   - **non-skill files inside an adapter directory** - `create-expo-app` writes
     `.claude/settings.json`. It collides with nothing, so keep it. The rule
     protects the skills, not the whole directory.
   - **anything else** - show both and ask. **Never resolve a conflict silently.**

For **native mobile** there is no CLI scaffolder. Say so, and give the Xcode or
Android Studio steps for the user to run, rather than pretending otherwise.

### A project with two parts is scaffolded twice

Once per part, each with its own scaffolder into its own directory - `create-vite`
into `web/`, `dotnet new` into `api/`. **Each part keeps its own config at its own
root.** Do not try to make one scaffolder produce both, and never put a
`package.json` above a part that is not a Node project.

Then, when the parts do not share an ecosystem, set up the pieces that bridge
them: **the contract file in `contracts/` at the product root**, at the path
`architect` recorded, plus its generation step, and the ecosystem-neutral
top-level command that runs both parts' checks. **Those are not optional extras** -
without them there is no way to verify the project as a whole, and the first
person to try will wire up something ad hoc.

**Put the contract at the product root, not inside the owning part.** It is the
one file both parts are bound by, `integrate` and `ci` both look for it there,
and a copy inside `api/` looks like `api`'s private business to everyone reading
`web/`. Record the regeneration command and each consumer's client-generation
command in `AGENTS.md`, with the directory each runs from.

## Step 5 - install the rest of the stack

**First, check what the scaffolder actually generated against what the plan asked
for.** Some accept no version flag at all: `create-expo-app` always generates for
its own current SDK, so a plan naming SDK 54 quietly gets SDK 57 with no error or
warning. If they differ, **say so and let the user choose** - accept what was
generated and update the plan, or pin the dependency afterwards. Never let that
gap pass unmentioned.

Everything from Step 1 that the framework scaffolder did not provide. Use the
real current command for each - `npm install`, `flutter pub add`, `pip install`,
whatever the ecosystem uses.

## Step 6 - wire it together so it actually works

Installed is not the same as usable:

- run the **ORM's init** and create the first schema file
- write **`.env.example`** naming every variable the project needs - **names
  only, never real values** - and confirm `.env` itself is gitignored
- add the **scripts**: dev, build, test, lint
- define the **one verification command** that runs the checks this project now
  genuinely has. Preferred order: typecheck, tests, build. **Never invent a
  check just to fill it in.**

## Step 7 - audit what landed

Walk the Tech and Architecture sections item by item and sort **every** named
piece into one of four buckets:

- **Installed and working** - with the evidence: the version, the passing command.
- **Needs a service that does not exist yet** - a hosted database, an auth
  provider account, a storage bucket. Not a failure. It is `host`'s job, and
  naming it here is what stops it being forgotten.
- **Deliberately deferred** - with the reason.
- **Missing** - it should be here and it is not. **Say so plainly.**

**A half-installed stack that reports success is the worst thing this skill can
do.** If something did not install, that is the headline, not a footnote.

## Step 8 - prove it runs

Install dependencies, then prove the project actually works. **What that means
depends on the platform:**

- **Web app, website, PWA** - run the production build, start the dev server, and
  confirm it responds.
- **Expo / React Native** - a dev server proves little without a device. Run the
  **typecheck** and **`expo-doctor`**, which checks the whole install for
  consistency. Then say plainly that nothing has run on a simulator or a real
  device yet.
- **Flutter** - `flutter analyze` and `flutter doctor`, with the same caveat.
- **Native mobile** - a build in Xcode or Android Studio, which is the user's to
  run.
- **Command-line tool** - **run the command**, with a real argument and with none,
  and show the output. There is no server to respond, so "it typechecks" is not
  evidence it runs.
- **Library or package** - typecheck, then run the one real test from Step 4. A
  library has no entry point to execute, so the test *is* the proof it loads.
- **Service with no UI** - start it and make one actual request against a real
  route. A process that boots without being called has not been shown to serve.

Then run the verification command. Report exactly what you ran and what happened.

**If it does not start, that is the result.** Do not describe a broken project
as scaffolded.

This step earns its place. On a real run it was the only thing that caught an
incompatible toolchain - the install had reported success, every file was in the
right place, and nothing was visibly wrong until the build was actually run.

## Step 9 - record reality

Fill in `AGENTS.md`:

- the **real** dev, build, test, and verification commands
- the **source layout that actually landed** - which shape (one application, two
  parts in one repo, separate repos), and the real directory for each part.
  `src/`, `lib/`, `app/`, `web/src` plus `api/` - whatever the framework and the
  architecture produced, or what Step 4 created directly when there was no
  scaffolder.
- **where the config lives.** In a two-part project each part has its own
  `package.json` and its own tooling, and knowing which root a command runs from
  is the difference between a working instruction and a confusing one.
- the **resolved versions**, read from the lockfile rather than from what you
  asked for. They are different facts.
- **the real build and start commands into the plan's Deployment section**, where
  `stack` wrote the intended shape. They are different facts, and `host` and
  `deploy` both read that section rather than this file's Commands block.
- **the `development` row in the Environments table.** It is the only environment
  that exists at this point and it exists *now* - created the moment there is
  code, not the moment something is hosted. Record where its configuration comes
  from (`.env`, a local file, or nothing) and that it holds no real data.
  **Leaving the table empty until `host` runs is what makes "no development
  default reaching production" a figure of speech instead of a comparison between
  two recorded things** - and `migrate` reads that last column before touching a
  schema.

**If an installed major version is newer than you can speak about confidently,
say so here and in your report**, and point at that version's own documentation
as the authority. A confidently wrong pattern from an older version is the most
likely way this workflow produces broken code.

Then fill in `blueprint/context/coding-standards.md`, which is **read by `build`,
`spec` and `review` as beating generic best practice**. It cannot do that while
it describes no particular project, and this is the moment the conventions stop
being guesses: the linter, the formatter, the test runner and the framework's own
layout are all now on disk.

**Do not touch `blueprint/context/fundamentals.md`.** That is the pack's, it
holds what is true regardless of stack, and it is overwritten on every install -
an edit there is lost and a project-specific rule there is lost with it. Anything
this project does differently is stated in `coding-standards.md`, which wins
where the two disagree.

`coding-standards.md` ships as prompts, and every one of them is a question this
step can now answer: the language and its
strictness settings, the formatter and linter, how files are named and where they
go, the import style, the error-handling pattern the framework expects, the test
runner and what a test file looks like here. Read the configs rather than
recalling defaults.

**Write the "Standards this project follows" section.** `review` audits against
what is named there and treats an unrecorded standard as not a finding - so
leaving it empty is what makes the security and accessibility lenses report
generic smells and nothing else. Name what this project actually holds itself to:
typically OWASP Top 10:2025 for a web project, OWASP MASVS for mobile, WCAG 2.2 AA for
anything with a UI, and honestly nothing beyond the fundamentals for a local
script. Take the bar from `blueprint/context/quality-bar.md` where `architect`
recorded one rather than choosing a stricter one here.

**Anything you could not determine, say so in the file** rather than filling it
with a plausible convention nobody chose; an invented standard is worse than an
absent one, because `review` will enforce it.

In a two-part project each part gets its own standards - a C# backend and a React
front end share nothing here - written into that part's own
`blueprint/context/coding-standards.md`.

Then add a `dev-notes/decisions.md` entry for anything you chose during setup
that the plan had not already settled, with the reason.

**Then say what comes next: `ci`.** It runs here rather than later, and the
reason is this step: the verification command and the runtime version it needs
were both just written, so there is nothing to wait for. **Waiting until the
suite is "worth protecting" means the suite grows unprotected** - every item
built before CI exists was built with nothing running on push.

## Re-running this later

Safe and expected when the stack grows. **Install only what is missing**, leave
everything else alone, and re-run the audit. Never re-scaffold over a project
that already has code.

## Rules

- **Nothing installs before the approval gate.**
- **Never install a language toolchain or SDK.** Report it as missing instead,
  **and record it in `blueprint/context/needs-you.md`** with the command that
  installs it and what it blocks. Reporting it only in conversation means the
  next session rediscovers it - which is what happened with the Postgres role:
  installed, running, and unusable because no role existed for the user.
- **Never overwrite a workflow file**, and never silently resolve a conflict.
- **Never invent a check, a script, or a test runner** to fill in a field.
- **Never write a real secret** into any file, including `.env.example`.
- **Check the runtime against what you are installing, first.** An engine warning
  is a blocker, not a warning.
- **Never trust an exit code alone.** Confirm the files you expected exist.
  `create-vite` exits 0 after refusing to do anything; `create-expo-app` exits 1
  for the same refusal. The codes are not consistent, so check the files.
- **Never copy the scaffolder's `.git/`.**
- **Fold in the framework's own agent guidance.** Never overwrite ours with it,
  and never throw it away.
- **Report what is missing as missing.** Honest and incomplete beats complete-
  looking and wrong.

## Formatting

Match `blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md` when it exists: short, scannable
markdown, lists for enumerations, a table when comparing options.
